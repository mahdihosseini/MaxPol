function c = fdcoeffF(k, xbar, x, flag_symbolic)

% Compute coefficients for finite difference approximation for the
% derivative of order k at xbar based on grid values at points in x.
%
% This function returns a row vector c of dimension 1 by n, where n=length(x),
% containing coefficients to approximate u^{(k)}(xbar), 
% the k'th derivative of u evaluated at xbar,  based on n values
% of u at x(1), x(2), ... x(n).  
%
% If U is a column vector containing u(x) at these n points, then 
% c*U will give the approximation to u^{(k)}(xbar).
%
% Note for k=0 this can be used to evaluate the interpolating polynomial 
% itself.
%
% Requires length(x) > k.  
% Usually the elements x(i) are monotonically increasing
% and x(1) <= xbar <= x(n), but neither condition is required.
% The x values need not be equally spaced but must be distinct.  
%
% This program should give the same results as fdcoeffV.m, but for large
% values of n is much more stable numerically.
%
% Based on the program "weights" in 
%   B. Fornberg, "Calculation of weights in finite difference formulas",
%   SIAM Review 40 (1998), pp. 685-691.
%
% Note: Forberg's algorithm can be used to simultaneously compute the
% coefficients for derivatives of order 0, 1, ..., m where m <= n-1.
% This gives a coefficient matrix C(1:n,1:m) whose k'th column gives
% the coefficients for the k'th derivative.
%
% In this version we set m=k and only compute the coefficients for
% derivatives of order up to order k, and then return only the k'th column
% of the resulting C matrix (converted to a row vector).  
% This routine is then compatible with fdcoeffV.   
% It can be easily modified to return the whole array if desired.
